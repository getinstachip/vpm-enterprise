Enterprise verilog package manager due to popular request. It's designed to simplify the management of IP cores and dependencies in hardware design workflows.

## Features

- Install submodules within repositories with dependencies automatically resolved
- Automatically handle synthesis collateral including what's needed for build (COMING SOON!)
- God-tier version control with a .lock file

## Installation

To install VPM, you don't need any dependencies! Just run the following command:

```bash
curl -sSfL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/getinstachip/vpm/main/install.sh | sh
```

After installation, you can use the `vpm` command in any terminal.

### Basic Commands

- Install a .v file and all submodule dependencies: `vpm install <top_module.v> <repo_url>`

## Very useful stuff

### vpm include "top_module"
After running `vpm include "top_module.v"`, the Verilog Package Manager parses the file and downloads all the submodules too. It generates .vh files and handles synthesis collateral.

Example: running `vpm include pfcache.v` finds all dependences and includes/configures them for you.
```
your_project/
├─ vpm_modules/
│  ├─ pfcache/
│     ├─ pfcache.v
│     ├─ pfcache.vh
│     ├─ ffetch.v
│     ├─ ffetch.vh
│     ├─ fwb_module.v
│     ├─ fwb_module.vh
│     └─ README.md // documentation of component you installed
└─ sim/
   └─pfcache_tb.v
```

## Configuration

### vpm.toml

Example `vpm.toml` file:

```yaml
// you can include entire repositories
[repositories]
https://github.com/ZipCPU/zipcpu = "0.4.4"
https://github.com/bensampson5/libsv = "0.1.2"
https://github.com/alexforencich/verilog-pcie = "0.2.4"

// or just specific modules
[modules]
pfcache = "0.4.4"
axis_arb_mux = "0.2.2"
```
Close your eyes, relax. Submodule dependencies are taken care of with our parser. We are working on handling synthesis collateral.

### vpm.lock (autogenerated)
```yaml
[repositories]
"https://github.com/ZipCPU/zipcpu" = "ee644d4"
"https://github.com/bensampson5/libsv" = "c5aff5d"
"https://github.com/alexforencich/verilog-pcie" = "25156a9"

[modules]
pfcache = { "https://github.com/ZipCPU/zipcpu/commit/ee6...", ffetch, fwb_module }
ffetch = { "https://github.com/ZipCPU/zipcpu/commit/ee6..." }
fwb_module = { "https://github.com/ZipCPU/zipcpu/commit/ee6..." }
axis_arb_mux = { "https://github.com/alexforencich/verilog-pcie/commit/251...", ... }
// ... (subdependencies for axis_arb_mux) 
```

## Enterprise version

We are receiving overwhelming interest for an enterprise version to manage internal IP for ASIC/FPGA companies.

[Join the waitlist if you're interested](https://www.waitlistr.com/lists/ce1719b7/vpm-enterprise-version-waitlist), we're launching an enterprise batch trial soon.
